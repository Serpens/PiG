epigraph,EpiGRAPH,kasia,16520826,"This tool sends the selected dataset to EpiGRAPH in order to perform an in-depth analysis with statistical and machine learning methods. The EpiGRAPH_ web service enables biologists to uncover hidden associations in vertebrate genome and epigenome datasets. Users can upload or import sets of genomic regions and EpiGRAPH will test a wide range of attributes (including DNA sequence and structure, gene density, chromatin modifications and evolutionary conservation) for enrichment or depletion among these regions. Furthermore, EpiGRAPH learns to predictively identify genomic regions that exhibit similar properties.

vcf_annotate,Annotate,kasia,???,"This tool uses vcfPytools' annotate command annotate a VCF file

Currently, either a hapmap or a dbsnp file should be provided, not both."
vcf_extract,Extract,kasia,???,This tool uses vcfPytools' extract command to extract reads from a specified region of a VCF file.
vcf_filter,Filter,kasia,,"This tool uses vcfPytools' filter command

Quality option will check the variant quality for each record and if it is below the defined value, the filter field will be populated with the filter entry Q[value].

Any value in the info string can be used for filtering by using the 'Filter by info' option. This option takes three values: the info string tag, the cutoff value and whether to filter out those records with less than (lt) or greater than (gt) this value. For example:

    DP 10 lt

would filter out all varianta with a depth (DP) less than 10 and the filter field would be populated with DP10.

This option can be defined as many times as required.",,https://github.com/AlistairNWard/vcfPytools
vcf_intersect,Intersect,kasia,???,"This tool uses vcfPytools' intersect command to generate the intersection of two VCF files

Two input files are required as input and the intersection of these two files is generated and sent to the output. These files must be sorted by genomic coordinate to function correctly, although the reference sequence order is no important.

The intersection can be calculated on two VCF files or a VCF and a BED file.

If the priority file argument is set (this must be equal to one of the input VCF files), then the record written to the output will come from this file. If this argument is not set, the record with the highest quality is written out.",,https://github.com/AlistairNWard/vcfPytools
